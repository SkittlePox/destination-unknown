A text adventure creation engine.
Now you can make a text adventure **without knowing a programming language!**

###How to use it
The engine reads information through a json file titled `gameconfig.json` which needs to be in the same directory as the core jar file.

It would help to learn the [json format](http://www.w3schools.com/json/), else you can look at the default config file and see get the jist of it.
